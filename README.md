`geostructpy` is an open-source Python library for geotechnical engineering, designed specifically for structural engineers. It provides tools for analyzing and designing shallow and deep foundations, pile raft foundations, deep excavations, and soil-structure interaction. 🏗️

## 🚀 Installation

Install `geostructpy` using pip:
```sh
pip install geostructpy
```
